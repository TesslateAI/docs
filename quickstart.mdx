## Create Your First Project

<Steps>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Project">
    Click the **"Create New Project"** button in the center or top-right corner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Source">
    Select how you want to start:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Template (Recommended)">
        Start with a blank React + Vite template

        - Enter project name (e.g., "My First App")
        - Add optional description
        - Click **Create Project**
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="GitHub">

        - Paste GitHub repository URL
        - Enter branch name (default: main)
        - Click **Create Project**
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Base">

</Steps>

## Build Your First Feature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Chat">
    At the bottom of the screen, you'll see the chat interface. Click to expand it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe What You Want">
    Type a natural language description of what you want to build. For example:

    ```
    Create a landing page with a hero section, feature cards,
    and a contact form. Use a blue color scheme.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an Agent">
    In the chat input, you'll see an agent selector dropdown. For your first project, use the default **Stream Agent**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Message">
    Press **Enter** or click the send button. The AI will:

    - Generate React components
    - Create necessary files
    - Auto-save to your project
    - Show progress in the chat
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Live Preview">
    As files are generated, the live preview updates automatically. You'll see your landing page appear in real-time!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Make Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Modifications">
    Continue chatting with the AI to refine your app:

    ```
    Change the hero background to a gradient from blue to purple.
    Add hover animations to the feature cards.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual Edits">
    Click the **Code** tab to view files. You can:

    - Browse the file tree
    - Click any file to open in the editor
    - Make manual changes
    - Click **Save** to update the preview
  </Step>

  <Step title="See Changes Live">
    Every change (AI-generated or manual) instantly appears in the live preview thanks to Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
  </Step>

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-dots" title="Be Specific in Prompts">
    The more detailed your description, the better the results. Include:
    - Specific features you want
    - Color schemes and styling preferences
    - Layout and structure details
    - Any specific libraries or patterns to use
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Iterate Incrementally">
    Build your application step by step:
    1. Start with basic structure
    2. Add features one at a time
    3. Refine styling and UX
    4. Test and debug

    This approach gives better results than trying to build everything at once.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Use the Right Agent">
    Different agents excel at different tasks:
    - **Stream Agent**: Fast iteration, UI building
    - **Iterative Agent**: Complex logic, multi-step tasks

    Switch agents based on your current need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="floppy-disk" title="Save Your Work">
