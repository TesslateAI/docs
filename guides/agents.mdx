## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are specialized AI assistants that generate and modify code based on your natural language instructions. Each agent has unique capabilities optimized for specific tasks.

## Agent Types

Tesslate Studio has two core agent types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Stream Agent" icon="water">
    **Best for:** UI building, fast iteration

    - Real-time streaming responses
    - Generates code continuously
    - Perfect for visual components
    - Faster for simple tasks
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iterative Agent" icon="rotate">
    **Best for:** Complex logic, multi-step tasks

    - Step-by-step reasoning
    - Uses tools and thinks through problems
    - Better for complex features
    - More accurate for logic-heavy work
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Agent Characteristics

Every agent has:

- **Icon & Name**: Visual identification
- **System Prompt**: Instructions that guide behavior
- **Model**: The AI model powering the agent (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Mode**: Stream or Iterative processing
- **Source Type**: Open source or closed source

## Agent Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover">
    Browse agents in the [Marketplace](/guides/marketplace)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install">
    Add agents to your [Library](/guides/library)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable">
    Toggle agents on/off in your library
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use">
    Select agents in project chat to generate code
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize">
    Edit prompts and models for custom agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Agents in Projects

### Selecting an Agent

In any project, you can choose which agent to use:

1. Open the chat interface
2. Click the agent selector dropdown
3. Choose from your enabled agents
4. Start chatting!

### When to Use Each Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stream Agent">
    Use Stream Agent when:
    - Building UI components
    - Creating landing pages
    - Making quick visual changes
    - Iterating rapidly on design
    - Need fast responses
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Iterative Agent">
    Use Iterative Agent when:
    - Implementing complex business logic
    - Working with APIs and data
    - Building multi-step features
    - Need careful reasoning
    - Debugging complex issues
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Agent Marketplace

The Marketplace offers:

- **Official Agents**: Built and maintained by Tesslate
- **Community Agents**: Created and shared by users
- **Specialized Agents**: Focused on specific frameworks or tasks

### Categories

- **Builder**: General-purpose building agents
- **Frontend**: UI-focused agents
- **Full-stack**: End-to-end development
- **Data & AI**: Data processing and ML

## Custom Agents

You can create custom agents by:

1. Forking an existing open-source agent
2. Creating from scratch in your library
3. Customizing the system prompt
4. Selecting the AI model
5. Publishing to the community (optional)

<Info>
  Custom agents let you specialize behavior for your specific needs, like using particular libraries or coding styles.
</Info>

## Agent Models

Agents can use different AI models:

- **GPT-4**: OpenAI's most capable model
- **Claude**: Anthropic's advanced model
- **Qwen**: Fast, efficient coding model
- **Custom Models**: Via OpenRouter integration

<Note>
  For closed-source agents, the model is fixed. For open-source agents, you can change the model in your library.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Choose the Right Agent">
    - Use Stream for UI, Iterative for logic
    - Switch agents mid-project as needed
    - Try different agents to find what works
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="message" title="Be Specific in Prompts">
    - Describe exactly what you want
    - Include technology preferences
    - Mention styling requirements
    - Specify behavior details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="Iterate Gradually">
    - Build features one at a time
    - Test after each change
    - Refine through conversation
    - Don't try to do everything at once
  </Accordion>
