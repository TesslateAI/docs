## Creating Custom Agents

### Method 1: Fork Existing Agent

Start from a working agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Agent">
    Browse your library or marketplace
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Fork">
    Click **Fork** on an open-source agent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name It">
    Give your fork a unique name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize">
    Modify the system prompt and settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Save to your library
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Try it in a test project
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Forking is the easiest way to create custom agents since you start with working prompts.
</Info>

### Method 2: Create from Scratch

Build from the ground up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Library">
    Go to your Library → Agents tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New">
    Click **Create New Agent**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Type">

  <Step title="Select Model">
    Choose AI model to power it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test & Iterate">
    Refine until it works well
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing System Prompts

The system prompt defines how your agent behaves. It's the most important customization.

### Prompt Structure

A good system prompt includes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="1. Role Definition">
    Define what the agent is:

    ```
    You are a specialized React developer focused on building
    accessible, performant user interfaces using Tailwind CSS
    and TypeScript.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="2. Responsibilities">
    What the agent should do:

    ```
    Your responsibilities:
    - Generate clean, typed React components
    - Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
    - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
    - Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
    - Write semantic HTML
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="3. Style Guidelines">
    Coding style preferences:

    ```
    Coding standards:
    - Use functional components with TypeScript
    - Prefer named exports over default exports
    - Use descriptive variable names
    - Include JSDoc comments for complex logic
    - Keep components under 200 lines
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cube" title="4. Technology Stack">
    Specific libraries and tools:

    ```
    Technology preferences:
    - React 18+ with TypeScript
    - Tailwind CSS 3+ for styling
    - React Hook Form for forms
    - Zod for validation
    - Lucide React for icons
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="ban" title="5. Constraints">
    What NOT to do:

    ```
    Avoid:
    - Inline styles (use Tailwind classes)
    - Class components (use hooks)
    - Any CSS libraries besides Tailwind
    - Large components (split into smaller ones)
    - Hardcoded values (use constants)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Prompts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tailwind Specialist">
    ```
    You are a React + Tailwind CSS specialist. Your job is to
    create beautiful, responsive components using Tailwind CSS
    utility classes.

    Guidelines:
    - Use only Tailwind classes (never inline styles or CSS files)
    - Make all components fully responsive (mobile-first)
    - Use Tailwind's color palette (e.g., blue-500, gray-100)
    - Apply consistent spacing (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24)
    - Include hover, focus, and active states
    - Use Tailwind's animation classes for transitions

    Default color scheme:
    - Primary: orange-500
    - Background: gray-50
    - Text: gray-900
    - Border: gray-200

    Always create components that work beautifully on mobile,
    tablet, and desktop screens.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Form Builder">
    ```
    You are a form-building specialist using React Hook Form
    and Zod for validation.

    Your expertise:
    - Create fully validated forms with React Hook Form
    - Use Zod schemas for type-safe validation
    - Show clear error messages below each field
    - Include loading and success states
    - Make forms accessible (labels, ARIA attributes)
    - Add proper TypeScript types

    Default patterns:
    - Use useForm hook with zodResolver
    - Create Zod schemas for all forms
    - Show errors in red text below inputs
    - Disable submit button during submission
    - Show success message after submission
    - Clear form on successful submit

    Always prioritize UX: clear labels, helpful error messages,
    visual feedback, and keyboard navigation.
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API Integration">
    ```
    You are a data-fetching and API integration specialist
    for React applications.

    Your focus:
    - Set up API calls with proper error handling
    - Implement loading states and error states
    - Use React Query for server state management
    - Create typed API clients
    - Handle authentication tokens
    - Implement retry logic

    Patterns to follow:
    - Create /services folder for API functions
    - Use React Query hooks (useQuery, useMutation)
    - Type all API responses with TypeScript
    - Show loading spinners during fetch
    - Display user-friendly error messages
    - Implement optimistic updates when appropriate

    Always handle errors gracefully and provide great UX
    during loading states.
