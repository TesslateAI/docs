## Getting Started with Agents

AI agents are your coding partners. Describe what you want in natural language, and they generate the code for you.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Natural Language" icon="message">
    No coding required - just describe it
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time Generation" icon="bolt">
    Watch code appear instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interactive" icon="comments">
    Refine through conversation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Aware" icon="brain">
    Agents understand your full project
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Your First Agent Interaction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project">
    Open any project in Tesslate Studio
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Agent">
    Choose an agent from the dropdown (try Stream Agent first)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe Feature">
    Type: "Create a hero section with a title, subtitle, and call-to-action button"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch Generation">
    Agent generates code in real-time
  </Step>

  <Step title="See Preview">
    Your hero section appears in the live preview
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine">
    Say: "Make the button larger and orange"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Start with simple requests to get comfortable, then gradually try more complex features.

## Writing Effective Prompts

### The Formula

Good prompts include:

1. **What** you want to build
2. **How** it should look or behave
3. **Which** technologies to use (optional)
4. **Why** specific requirements matter (optional)

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI Components">
    **Basic:**
    - "Create a button"

    **Better:**
    - "Create a primary button with rounded corners and an orange background"

    **Best:**
    - "Create a primary button with rounded corners, orange background (#F97316), white text, and a hover effect that darkens it slightly. Use Tailwind CSS."

    **Why best wins:** Specific colors, exact styling, technology choice
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Layouts">
    **Basic:**
    - "Make a navigation bar"

    **Better:**
    - "Create a navigation bar with logo on left and menu on right"

    **Best:**
    - "Create a sticky navigation bar with the logo on the left, menu items (Home, Features, Pricing, About) centered, and a 'Sign Up' button on the right. Use flexbox and make it responsive - stack vertically on mobile."

    **Why best wins:** Exact layout, specific items, responsive behavior
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Features">
    **Basic:**
    - "Add a contact form"

    **Better:**
    - "Create a contact form with name, email, and message fields"

    **Best:**
    - "Create a contact form with fields for name (text), email (validated), and message (textarea). Include form validation using React Hook Form and Zod. Show error messages in red below each field. Add a submit button that shows a loading state."

    **Why best wins:** Exact fields, validation library, error handling, UX details
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prompt Patterns

### Adding Features

```
"Add a [feature] that [does something] with [specific details]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Add a product card that displays an image, title, price, and 'Add to Cart' button"
- "Add a search bar that filters the product list in real-time as the user types"
- "Add a dark mode toggle that switches between light and dark themes"

### Modifying Existing Code

```
"Make the [element] [change] by [method]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Make the navigation bar sticky at the top when scrolling"
- "Make the hero section full height with content vertically centered"
- "Make all buttons have a subtle shadow and slight lift on hover"

### Styling Changes

```
"Change the [element] to have [styles]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Change the primary color to #F97316 throughout the app"
- "Change the font to Inter and increase the base size to 16px"
- "Change the card backgrounds to white with a subtle border instead of shadows"

### Debugging

```
"Fix the [issue] where [problem description]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Fix the bug where the form submits even with validation errors"
- "Fix the layout breaking on mobile screens below 640px"
- "Fix the TypeScript error in the UserProfile component"

## Advanced Techniques

### Referencing Existing Code

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file" title="Mention Files">
    "Update the Button component in components/Button.tsx to use the new color scheme"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Reference Components">
    "Make the ProductCard component match the styling of the existing FeatureCard"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="Specify Location">
    "Add a new component called Newsletter in the components/marketing folder"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Iterative Refinement

Build features gradually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    "Create a basic product grid showing 6 products"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Details">
    "Add product images, titles, and prices to each card"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enhance">
    "Add hover effects and 'Quick View' buttons to each product"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Functionality">
    "Make the products filterable by category"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Polish">
    "Add loading skeletons while products load"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Step Features

For complex features, break down the steps:

```
"I want to build a shopping cart feature. Let's start by:

1. Creating a Cart context to manage cart state
2. Adding 'Add to Cart' buttons to product cards
3. Creating a cart sidebar that shows added items
4. Adding quantity controls and remove buttons
5. Calculating and displaying the total

Let's start with step 1 - create the Cart context."
```

<Info>
  Breaking down complex features helps the agent understand the full scope and build it correctly piece by piece.
